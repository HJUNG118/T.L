### Release Date: 

* 20xx-Xxx-xx

### New Features:

* Created new builds for RS232, RS485, and USB Interfaces with default values set correctly for DD 
  and for D7 in the case of RS485

### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed problem with SM5 mode not sending poll requests to the coordinator when enabled to do so. 
  The fix looks at SO, bit 0 to know whether or not to send a poll request if the radio has a 
  cyclic sleep wake up. If the radio has a pin wakeup, A1, bit 3 determines whether or not to send 
  a poll request to get data from the coordinator.

* Fixed program loads to work like DigiMesh 2.4 so that a CTU load can work with an RS485 adapter.

### Known Issues / Errata:

* An extra byte of data may be observed during OTA data transmissions.

### Release Date: 

* 2009-Mar-05

### New Features:

* None

### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed problem with duplicate packets being displayed on UART when the sender is expecting an ACK. 
  The reduced packet tracker timeout on release 10e2 made it possible to track more packets, but it 
  introduced this bug. Fixed the problem by increasing the packet tracker timeout on received 
  frames that request an ACK.
  
* Fixed a problem with not sending an ACK on a duplicate packet. If the sender missed the ACK the 
  first time the packet was received, then it needs an ACK on subsequent retries, even though the 
  destination node discards the packet because it was previously output to the UART.

### Known Issues / Errata:

* An extra byte of data may be observed during OTA data transmissions.

### Release Date: 

* 2009-Feb-24

### New Features:

* Added CK command to report the checksum of the configuration in RAM. This helps to determine if 
  the configuration has changed.

* Imposed a limit on CT command to be no more than ten minutes to be consistent with other 
  platforms.

### Bug Fixes:

* Fixed bug to recover a global boolean variable after an RE command. If MM is 1 or 2 before RE 
  command, RR can still be set after RR command.
  
* Fixed bug by rearranging the MXI files to include MM before RR. This allows an error to occur if 
  RR is set with MM set to 1 or 2.

### Release Date: 

* 2008-Dec-10

### New Features:

* None

### Bug Fixes:

* Fix bug when using sleep mode. The receiving module would not always send RX date out the UART 
  from the transmitting module that was being reset/power cycled between transmissions.
	* This was caused by the packet ID being set to the same number on the transmitting module 
	  after each reset and the receiving module not timing out packet tracking entries because the 
	  timer does not run during sleep.

### Release Version:

* 10C4 - XBee 802.15.4

### Release Date: 

* 2007-Oct-23

### New Features:

* None

### Bug Fixes:

* ADC/DIO passing did not work when MM != 0. ADC/DIO data will not work when not in MM=0. If a user 
  attempts to set a Dx line to a ADC/DIO setting when not in MM=0 an error will occur. ADC/DIO is 
  disabled when not in MM=0.

* An OTA AI command would cause a response to go out the UART of the remote, not the radio which 
  sent the OTA command. This has been fixed in this version.

* If an OTA command was sent to an invalid address, extra data was returned in the error frame, 
  this has been fixed in this version.

* 12C0 - XBee 802.15.4, 1-Wire Sensor Adapter

### Release Date: 

* 2007-Jun-29

### New Features:

* Over-the-air commands (OTA commands). New API frames for sending command and receiving the 
  response. Not all commands are supported for this release. The following commands are not 
  supported and will return error:
	* ATND – Network Discover
	* ATED – Energy Detect
	* ATDN – Discover Node 
	* ATAS – Active Scan
	* ATVL – Long Version.
	
* 12C0 firmware supports select Watchport sensors using a special interface board. OTA commands 
  must be used to setup the radio as the radio’s serial port is used to communicate with the 
  sensors.

### Bug Fixes:

* None

### Known Issues / Errata:

* API Mode. When setting a parameter with AT API and OTA command frames, if the command name field 
  contains a space character (0x20), subsequent 1 and 2 byte commands when queried will always 
  return error. Radio will need to be reset to clear this state.

* 12C0 firmware: ATMY default was incorrectly set to 0xFFFF for this release.

### New Features:

* None

### Bug Fixes:

* ATRR - ACKs were not recognized when sending data to a modem using its 64 bit address when 
  ATMY<0. The source address of the ACK was being transmitted using the 16-bit address where as the 
  transmitting modem was expecting the ACK source address to be the 64-bit address.

* ATND - When issuing an API AT cmd for ATND, the responses were not being sent out the UART.

* I/O line passing - PWM were not being updated with the correct data when DIO and ADC lines were 
  defined in the received I/O line data.

### Release Date: 

* 2006-Apr-20

### New Features:

* None

### Bug Fixes:

* ATSM = 6 was removed in 107X. This caused problems for certain customer who have already shipped 
  with firmware version 106X and were using ATSM=6. ATSM has been added back into this version of 
  firmware. It is not recommended to use ATSM=6 for new designs. Setting SM=6 causes ATCE to be set 
  to 1. When changing from SM=6 to any other SM value will cause ATCE to be set to 0. This behavior 
  for SM6 is consistent with 106X.
