* 1161 - XBee-PRO 868, RS232 Adapter
* 1361 - XBee-PRO 868, RS485 Adapter

* 1761 - XBee-PRO 868, Digital I/O Adapter

### Release Date: 

* 2011-Jan-06

### New Features:

* Added asynchronous sleep modes and support for indirect messaging.

### Bug Fixes:

* Increased the time that a node will wait to receive a network discovery response to account for 
  the time it takes for the request to propagate.

* Fixed bug where no status was returned for a failed RMT AT CMD Request transmission.

* Fixed a bug where the PWM-RSSI output was not correct.

* Fixed a problem where DIN/DOUT were not configured correctly for AIO/DIO adapters.

* Changes to the ATCT (command mode timeout) would not be applied until after command mode was 
  exited (even if an ATAC was done). This has been fixed.

* Fixed bug where an incomplete API frame would corrupt the next API packet in API mode 2.

* Fixed bug where the pullup on DIN was not getting properly set.

### Known Issues / Errata:

* None

### Release Date: 

* 2009-May-21

### New Features:

* None

### Bug Fixes:

* Updated the .mxi file with ATIC, ATIR, ATLT, ATSB, ATD9, ATCK commands.

* ATM0, ATM1 are set when command mode exits or AC. ATM0, ATM1 can also be read.

* Code changes made to improve manufacturing yields.

### Known Issues / Errata:

* If the receiving module is streaming data out the UART and a ‘+++’ is sent to the module it will 
  not enter command mode until after there is a break in the data.
