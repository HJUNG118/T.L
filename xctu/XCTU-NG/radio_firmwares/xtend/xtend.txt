### Release Version:

* 206E - 9XTEND 9600/115K HOPPING
* 226E - 9XTEND Australia

### Release Date:

* 2008-Jun-05

### New Features:

* None

### Bug Fixes:

* A problem with extra garbage being sent out the serial port of the receiving radio when the 
  sending radio is set for SM=1 and MT=3 and data is sent after wakeup. This was caused by two 
  things:
	* The sending radio was clearing the payload of a retransmission upon wakeup causing the 
	  transmission of a MAC header without data.
	* The second problem was that the receiving radio improperly handled the 0 length reception and 
	  assumed a minimal length. When the minimal length was decremented, it became 0xffff causing a 
	  large stream of garbage data to be output the serial port. 

* A problem with an extended response time to a binary command following wakeup. It was taking 
  around 65ms rather than the normal 400us. This was caused by asserting CTS too early. Fix was to 
  wait until power settled before asserting CTS.

### Known Issues / Errata:

### Release Version:

* 206D - 9XTEND 9600/115K HOPPING

### Release Date:

* 2008-May-07

### New Features:

* None

### Bug Fixes:

* FH command when entered in binary command mode. This command did not work in binary mode prior to 
  this release. FH forces a long preamble header on transmissions.

### Known Issues / Errata:

### Release Version:

* 206C - 9XTEND 9600/115K HOPPING

### Release Date:

* 2008-Feb-05

### New Features:

* None

### Bug Fixes:

* Problem with CTS being asserted during transmissions when operating in RS-485 mode.

* Problem with receiving a successful TX_STATUS message on the sending node when the receiving node 
  did not output the transmission to its serial port. This occurred because the sending radio 
  toggled power between each transmission and the initial frame ID is random for the first 
  transmission following reset. The receiving node, not knowing anything about the reset of the 
  sender would occasionally receive the same random frame ID twice in a row and discard the second 
  packet as a duplicate. Problem was fixed by adding a timeout on the receiving end. If one second 
  expires between receptions, the second frame is output, even if the frame ID and source address 
  are the same as the previous frame received.

### Known Issues / Errata:

### Release Version:

* 206B - 9XTEND 9600/115K HOPPING

### Release Date:

* 2007-Dec-14

### New Features:

* None

### Bug Fixes:

* Channel hopping was not occurring when transmissions and receptions occurred alternately (i.e. a 
  transmission between each reception as would happen in a loopback test). In this case, all 
  transmissions were erroneously occurring on the same channel.

### Release Version:

### Release Date:

* 2007-Oct

### New Features:

* Support for controlling long headers through the TX16 command.
	* Bit 1 (0x02) forces a long header to precede the packet
	* Bit 2 (0x04) Disables the long header from being sent, even if HT is expired.
		* If bits 1 and 2 are both set, a long header will be sent.
