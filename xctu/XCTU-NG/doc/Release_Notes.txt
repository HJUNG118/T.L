Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This document provides the latest release information for XCTU, the
configuration and testing tool for Digi International Inc. radio modems.

XCTU 6.5.10, May 2022
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Changes with respect to previous version
    * Added support for the new XBee 3 Global LTE Cat 1 and XBee 3 North America
	  LTE Cat 1 modules.
    * Other minor bug fixes and improvements
      See the Change log within XCTU for more information.

2. Supported Operating Systems
   XCTU currently supports the following Operating Systems:
    * Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 (32 and 64 bits)
    * Mac OS X, 10.6 and higher versions (only 64 bits)
    * Linux (32 and 64 bits)

      For additional information about the system requirements, refer to the 
      built-in documentation.

3. Known Issues and Limitations
    * XCTU is not compatible with the following Digi RF devices:
        - XStream OEM RF modules family
        - XCite OEM RF modules family

    * XCTU includes a mechanism to avoid the computer to go to sleep 
      automatically in Windows and MacOS systems when it is performing long 
      duration tasks (i.e.: network discovery, range test, etc.). However, if 
      you force the computer to sleep while XCTU is performing such tasks, the 
      USB ports that XCTU was communicating with may become unresponsive after 
      the system wakes from sleep. Furthermore, if you try to close the 
      communication with them they could hang and they won't recover even if 
      you close XCTU. 

      If this happens you must unplug and plug again the USB cable to restore 
      the communication with the port. You can do this even while XCTU is 
      running.

    * ZigBee local modules configured as End Devices will not be able to 
      perform Network discovery in the Network working mode.

    * XLR PRO Radio Solution and programmable XBee radio modules do not support 
      the recovery feature provided by XCTU.

    * UNIX-based operating systems allow you to open multiple instances of the 
      same port. While Windows avoids this scenario, it can produce unexpected 
      behaviors if you have the same port open simultaneously by different apps 
      in Linux.

    * Cellular modem update over USB only works in Windows. In addition, it
      requires that the appropriate USB drivers are installed on the computer
      and the usage of either a Digi XBIB-CU-TH development board or own
      hardware that makes a USB port available to the PC.

    * Added support for modem update over USB to XBee 3 Cellular LTE CAT 1 and
      XBee 3 Cellular LTE-M/NB-IoT modules.
    
    * Secure sessions
      Added support for secure sessions in XCTU. This includes:
        - New authentication dialog to configure the password of the XBee
          device when acting as server in a session.
        - Establish a secure session with a remote XBee device when needed
          asking for the remote password through an interactive dialog.
    
    * Added support to configure pre and post scripts in the Profile Editor
      tool.
    
    * Other bug fixes and improvements
      See the Change log within XCTU for more information.

2. Supported Operating Systems
   XCTU currently supports the following Operating Systems:
    * Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 (32 and 64 bits)
    * Mac OS X, 10.6 and higher versions (only 64 bits)
    * Linux (32 and 64 bits)

      For additional information about the system requirements, refer to the 
      built-in documentation.

3. Known Issues and Limitations
    * XCTU is not compatible with the following Digi RF devices:
        - XStream OEM RF modules family
        - XCite OEM RF modules family

    * XCTU includes a mechanism to avoid the computer to go to sleep 
      automatically in Windows and MacOS systems when it is performing long 
      duration tasks (i.e.: network discovery, range test, etc.). However, if 
      you force the computer to sleep while XCTU is performing such tasks, the 
      USB ports that XCTU was communicating with may become unresponsive after 
      the system wakes from sleep. Furthermore, if you try to close the 
      communication with them they could hang and they won't recover even if 
      you close XCTU. 

      If this happens you must unplug and plug again the USB cable to restore 
      the communication with the port. You can do this even while XCTU is 
      running.

    * ZigBee local modules configured as End Devices will not be able to 
      perform Network discovery in the Network working mode.

    * XLR PRO Radio Solution and programmable XBee radio modules do not support 
      the recovery feature provided by XCTU.

    * UNIX-based operating systems allow you to open multiple instances of the 
      same port. While Windows avoids this scenario, it can produce unexpected 
      behaviors if you have the same port open simultaneously by different apps 
      in Linux.

    * Cellular modem update over USB only works in Windows. In addition, it
      requires that the appropriate USB drivers are installed on the computer
      and the usage of either a Digi XBIB-CU-TH development board or own
      hardware that makes a USB port available to the PC.

    * XLR PRO Radio Solution and programmable XBee radio modules do not support 
      the recovery feature provided by XCTU.

    * UNIX-based operating systems allow you to open multiple instances of the 
      same port. While Windows avoids this scenario, it can produce unexpected 
      behaviors if you have the same port open simultaneously by different apps 
      in Linux.


XCTU 6.3.7, April 2017
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Changes with respect to previous version
    * Internal release.

2. Supported Operating Systems
   XCTU currently supports the following Operating Systems:
    * Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 (32 and 64 bits)
    * Mac OS X, 10.6 and higher versions (only 64bits)
    * Linux (32 and 64 bits)

      For additional information about the system requirements, refer to the 
      built-in documentation.

3. Known Issues and Limitations
    * XCTU is not compatible with the following Digi RF devices:
        - XStream OEM RF modules family
        - XCite OEM RF modules family

    * XCTU includes a mechanism to avoid the computer to go to sleep 
      automatically in Windows and MacOS systems when it is performing long 
      duration tasks (i.e.: network discovery, range test, etc.). However, if 
      you force the computer to sleep while XCTU is performing such tasks, the 
      USB ports that XCTU was communicating with may become unresponsive after 
      the system wakes from sleep. Furthermore, if you try to close the 
      communication with them they could hang and they won't recover even if 
      you close XCTU. 

      If this happens you must unplug and plug again the USB cable to restore 
      the communication with the port. You can do this even while XCTU is 
      running.

    * ZigBee local modules configured as End Devices will not be able to 
      perform Network discovery in the Network working mode.

    * XLR PRO Radio Solution and programmable XBee radio modules do not support

      the system wakes from sleep. Furthermore, if you try to close the 
      communication with them they could hang and they won't recover even if 
      you close XCTU. 

      If this happens you must unplug and plug again the USB cable to restore 
      the communication with the port. You can do this even while XCTU is 
      running.

    * ZigBee local modules configured as End Devices will not be able to 
      perform Network discovery in the Network working mode.

    * XLR PRO Radio Solution and programmable XBee radio modules do not support 
      the recovery feature provided by XCTU.

XCTU 6.1.0, December 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Changes with respect to previous version
    * Network working mode
      A new working mode called Network has been implemented in XCTU. In this 
      new working mode you can see the topology of a local radio module's 
      network.

      The highlights of the Network working mode include the following 
      features:
        - Possibility to discover and represent the network topology of 
          802.15.4, ZigBee and DigiMesh protocols.
        - Display the network topology using different built-in profiles.
        -  Navigate between nodes moving and zooming them.
        - Represent all the network nodes in a table with details.
        - Obtain the links between nodes as well as their link quality.
        - Search for a specific node and highlight it.
        - Save a picture of the network.
        - Attach or detach the network view being able to display more than one 
          network at the same time.

    * Device Cloud working mode
      Another working mode called Device Cloud has been also added. This new 
      working mode allows you to learn about Device Cloud by Etherios platform, 
      create an account and access your personal Device Cloud page.

    * Range Test tool
      The Range Test tool has been included within the Tools drop-down menu of 
      the main toolbar. This tool allows you to perform a range test between a 
      local radio module and any of the remote modules working in the same 
      network as the local one.
      
      The highlights of the Range Test tool include the following features:
        - The tool is able to perform range tests of 802.15.4, ZigBee and 
          DigiMesh protocols regardless of the working mode (AT or API) of the 
          modules.
        - Chart control displaying the current and historic link qualities 
          between modules.
        - Different controls indicating the number of packets sent, lost, etc.

    * Firmware Explorer tool
      The Firmware Explorer tool allows you to navigate through the firmware 
      library contained in XCTU displaying the different firmware versions as 
      well as their settings. It also gives you the possibility to load and 
      generate firmware profiles. The tool is included within the Tools 
      drop-down menu of the main toolbar.

    * Remote firmware update
      The remote firmware update feature has been implemented. Now you are able 
      to update the firmware of a remote radio module the same way you do with 
      a local one. In order to perform a remote firmware update, the local 
      radio module must be configured in API operation mode.

      Remote firmware update functionality is limited to the following radio 
      modules:
        - XBee/XBee-PRO ZB
        - Programmable XBee-PRO ZB
        - XBee/XBee-PRO ZB SMT
        - Programmable XBee-PRO ZB SMT
        - XBee-PRO 900HP
        - XBee 865LP
        - XBee 868LP

    * Lots of bug fixes and improvements
      See the Change log within XCTU for more information.

2. Supported Operating Systems
   XCTU currently supports the following Operating Systems:
    * Microsoft Windows XP/Vista/7/8 (32 and 64 bits)
    * Mac OS X, 10.6 and higher versions (only 64bits)

      For additional information about the system requirements, refer to the 
      built-in documentation.

3. Known Issues and Limitations
    * XCTU is not compatible with the following Digi RF devices:
        - XStream OEM RF modules family
        - XCite OEM RF modules family

    * XCTU includes a mechanism to avoid the computer to go to sleep 
      automatically in Windows and MacOS systems when it is performing long 
      duration tasks (i.e.: network discovery, range test, etc.). However, if 
      you force the computer to sleep while XCTU is performing such tasks, the 
      USB ports that XCTU was communicating with may become unresponsive after 
      the system wakes from sleep. Furthermore, if you try to close the 
      communication with them they could hang and they won't recover even if 
      you close XCTU.  

      If this happens you must unplug and plug again the USB cable to restore 
      the communication with the port. You can do this even while XCTU is 
      running.

    * ZigBee local modules configured as End Devices will not be able to 
      perform Network discovery in the Network working mode.
